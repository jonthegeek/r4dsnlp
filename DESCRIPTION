Description: The R4DS Online Learning Community is a community of R learners at 
    all skill levels working together to improve their skills. The community 
    features a Slack workspace, on which learners ask questions and mentors help 
    them find answers. Here we use the BERT NLP model from Google to analyze
    those questions and answers.
