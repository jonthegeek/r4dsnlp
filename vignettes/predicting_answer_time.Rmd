After a user asks a question, answers are sometimes immediate, and sometimes take a long back-and-forth discussion before the question is resolved.
Here we attempt to predict how long it will take for a question to be answered.

## Definitions

* **question_start_ts:** The timestamp on which the question was posted.
* **question_resolution_ts:** The timestamp on which the question was marked as resolved using the "heavy_check_mark" convention used by the R4DS Online Learning Community mentors.
